```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(roxygen2)
library(devtools)
# need both of these packages in order for document to work

```

In a function, R files have to have inputs and parameters at the top using the following syntax 
```{r}
#' name of function
#'
#' description of what it's going to do (can be multiple lines)
#' @param
#' @param
#' @param
#' @author
#' @examples
#' @return output variable

```

- Run document() to enable help functionality (?nameoffunction) - pulls it directly from the function.R file 
- Every so often, clean and rebuild the repository (Build tab>more>clean and rebuild)

### Creating data documentation

- Create a data folder in the package directory
- have a data file (df) in your environment
- Run: use_data(dfname) - creates a .rda file in the data folder containing the data in df
